Devops Course assignment

Here is the correct order of Git commands to complete each task on GitHub:

### 1. Configure Git with your name and email ✍️
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 2. Clone the project repository from GitHub 🔄
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gowtham-beep/IBM--assignment.git
cd IBM--assignment
```

### 3. Create a new feature branch 🌿
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

### 4. Add a new file called `feature.py` to your branch 📂
```bash
touch feature.py
git add feature.py
```

### 5. Commit your changes with a message 💬
```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature implementation"
```

### 6. Push your changes to the remote repository 🚀
```bash
git push origin new-feature
```

### 7. Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch ⬇️
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 8. Remove the `feature.py` file from your branch ❌
```bash
git rm feature.py
```

### 9. Commit the removal of the file and push the changes 📤
```bash
git commit -m "Remove feature.py"
git push origin new-feature
```

This flow ensures that you configure Git, clone the repository, create a new feature branch, manage file additions and deletions, and handle commits and pushes to the remote repository effectively.
